# Pipelines
Pipelines used in bioinformatic analysis

## List

2. Bulk segregant analysis (NGS-BSA)
3. QTL mapping
4. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis
5. Genome synteny
6. Phylogeny construction (phylogenetic tree)
7. SRA file processing
8. CUN&RUN seq

P.S. These bioinformatic pipelines are frequently-used during my PhD stage, like DNA-seq, RNA-seq, gene family analysis, etc. I will update more pipelines recently. Please feel free to contact me (jiaxq.nju@gmail.com) for any help. @2020-05-19
